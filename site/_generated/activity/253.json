  "content": "### Announcement\n\nOn April 9th of last year, we launched the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org/) to offer a simple, more flexible path for open-source projects in need of support.\r\n\r\nWe began with the communities we knew well — starting close to home helped us build with trust, refine our approach, and lay a strong foundation. A year later, we’ve grown to [14 projects](https://www.commonhaus.org/#our-projects), and we’re ready to welcome more.\r\n\r\nCommonhaus is a community rooted in trust, light governance, and shared care for the future of our projects. Our approach is guided by a few simple principles:\r\n\r\n- Automate the administrivia so maintainers can focus on the work that matters\r\n- Offer stability without unnecessary complexity\r\n- Keep developers at the center of decision-making\r\n\r\nAt its core, Commonhaus exists to support open-source projects in a way that feels grounded, sustainable, and community-aligned.\r\n\r\n## Where We're Going & What We're Looking For\r\n\r\nTo keep building that future, we need a few more things:\r\n\r\n**More individuals as supporters and members.** We're deeply grateful to our [individual supporters](https://www.commonhaus.org/about/sponsors/supporters.html) who've helped make this a developer-powered organization from day one. If you're aligned with our mission and want to shape a different kind of support system for open source, [come join us](https://www.commonhaus.org/community/#support-our-efforts) — we're saving you a seat at the table.\r\n\r\n**Corporate sponsors for our Advisory Board.** A huge thanks to our [infrastructure sponsors](https://www.commonhaus.org/about/sponsors/providers.html) for helping us build a support structure that benefits both our projects and our mission.\r\n\r\nNow, we're looking to grow our base of corporate sponsors — companies and vendors who rely on our projects or believe in open source and want to invest in its sustainability. Your support doesn’t just pay for operational essentials; it helps fund writers, designers, and other contributors who can elevate the work of our projects. [Gold and Silver sponsors](https://www.commonhaus.org/about/sponsorship.html) get seats on our Advisory Board — a way to bring your voice into the room as we align Foundation efforts with both community priorities and industry realities. It’s also a meaningful way to connect your organization’s values with the long-term sustainability of the open source projects you rely on.\r\n\r\n**More diverse projects.** We’re especially eager to welcome projects from beyond our current circles. We started close to home — many of our first collaborators are Java Champions, and our early growth included several Red Hat–sponsored projects, reflecting long-standing relationships and shared values. Those trusted relationships helped shape what Commonhaus is — and now, we’re actively looking to broaden the ecosystems we support.\r\n\r\nWe’re especially well-suited for established projects with active use, steady maintainers, and a solid grasp of open source — the unsung heroes and workhorses that don’t need guardrails, just a supportive, neutral home. Fresh perspectives make us all stronger, and if that sounds like your project, [we should talk](https://www.commonhaus.org/community/#contribute-a-project).\r\n\r\n## Our Commitment\r\n\r\nAs we enter our second year, our promise remains the same: to keep things simple, practical, and focused on what matters. Commonhaus is here to offer more than just a financial framework — we’re here to support the people doing the work.\r\n\r\nWe'll continue to:\r\n\r\n- Provide lightweight fiscal sponsorship without unnecessary complexity\r\n- Support leadership transitions as a normal, healthy part of project life\r\n- Help projects build resilience — whether or not they pursue funding\r\n- Invest in shared support for non-code contributions like writing and design\r\n- Foster a learning community where maintainers can connect, share, and grow\r\n\r\nWe’re not here to reinvent open source — just to offer steady, thoughtful support for the people and projects that keep it going.\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who's been part of our first year. Whether you're maintaining a project, lending expertise, or just cheering us on — we're glad you're here. Here's to the next year of building something sustainable, thoughtful, and open.\r\n\r\n🏡 🙏 🥰 🚀\n\n### \n\n\r\n",
